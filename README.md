# JoshBlog
This project is a website I developed for a client. This is a multipage site containing a blog and a page for the clients up and coming book.

The technology I used for this project is HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a little Javascript and Jquiery. I plan on implementing a database in the future to store subscriber's emails and names.

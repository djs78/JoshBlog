# JoshBlog
This project is a website I developed for a client. This is a multipage site that contains an about me page, blog page,
contact me page and coming soon page for an upcoming book my client will be releasing.
The technology I used for this project is HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
and a little Javascript and Jquiery. I plan on implementing a database in the future to store subscriber's emails and names.
